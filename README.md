# 🌍 CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global **CO₂ emissions** and related indicators using the **Our World in Data** dataset.  

The analysis focuses on:  
- Long-term **trends in CO₂ emissions** across countries and regions  
- Historical responsibility of countries for global emissions  
- **Emission efficiency** relative to GDP  
- Relationship between emissions and **quality of life indicators**  

The main analysis was implemented in **Python**, with supplementary analysis and visualizations in **MATLAB**.
